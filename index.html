                        Is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox philosophical schools of Hinduism.
                        <br><br>
                        There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "Yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures or asanas
                        <br><br>
                        The practice of yoga has been thought to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions; possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda, and also referenced in the Upanishads, though it most likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to the Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the 2nd century BCE, and gained prominence in the west in the 20th century after being first introduced by Swami Vivekananda. Hatha yoga texts began to emerge sometime between the 9th and 11th century with origins in tantra.

                        We believe yoga is for everyone. People often come to yoga with the idea they are there to stretch, or to relax, or to contort their bodies into impressive-looking postures.<br><br>
                        But the magic that usually hooks people is that through yoga, they connect with a deeper, calmer place within themselves. Ultimately, that is the goal of yoga: to allow us to reconnect with our inner Selves.<br><br>

                        Anyone can practice… except lazy people. Lazy people can’t practice.
